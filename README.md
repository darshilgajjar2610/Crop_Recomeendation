# Crop Recommendation System Using Machine Learning

#📊 Example Interpretation

If your input conditions were:
Nitrogen: 90
Phosphorus: 40
Potassium: 43
Temperature: 25°C
Humidity: 80%
pH: 6.5
Rainfall: 150 mm
Then the model might predict → Muskmelon

That means, based on the soil and weather data, Muskmelon has the highest chance of successful cultivation under those conditions.
🚜 Real-World Use
#Farmers, agricultural researchers, or policymakers can use this:

#To decide which crop is best suited for specific regions or seasons.
#To optimize yield and sustainability.
#To reduce risk of poor crop selection.
